# Y9 IT ----  ESP IoT Portfolio
This is a portfolio containing the work for our assessment.

There is:

the GitHub Repostiory Setup, Code + Setup Images for LED Blink Demo Task, Code + Setup Images Inputs & Outputs Task, Code + Setup Images Analog Data Input Reader Tasak and The Essay on the IoT in Agriculture.

Note: Mr Zampogna, I was not sure whether to do individual repositories for each task or not so I put them in seperate folders within the overall repo.
